## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

Category: External API Tool
This application resembles a real time stock-searching application. It allows
the user to input 1 to 3 stock tickers separated by commas and returns a multitude
of stock parameters. The parameters are displayed in a neatly organized table.
If the stock market is open, the program outputs the stock's current
price and can be refreshed to update price changes according to the current value.
If the market is closed, the program displays the last closing price for the specified
stock. In addition to the stock price, the program returns the full company name,
the associated exchange where the stock is listed, the daily high price, the daily low price,
the current daily volume of the stock, and the change in price as a percentage. The user
can then select one of the stocks to inquire news about. The program pulls up to 8 news
headlines and displays them to the user in a text area.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I created this project with javafx and I feel like I am much more comfortable
using javafx after this project. Something new that I learned was implementing
the tableview class and being able to display data in a tableview object.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I would start the program as soon as it was released and implement both API's
before proceeding further. I wasted a lot of time attempting to
make certain ideas come together before testing my chosen API's and ensuring
that they accurately contained the data that I wanted to display.
